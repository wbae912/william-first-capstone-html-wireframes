            <h3>Keep track of your lists</h3>
            <p>Forget-Me-Not keeps a record of your lists so you can always have them on hand. Just remembered that you need
               to bring toiletries for that road trip? Access your lists and add it. Now, you're covered!

            <h3>Check-off your items</h3>
            <p>Whether it's another day to the office or you're going to the beach, take a look at your list. As you pack or bring
               your necessary items with you, check them off the list so you can keep track of what you have and you're still missing.
